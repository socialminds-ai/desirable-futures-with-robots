# Desirable Futures with Robots — landing site

A single-page editorial site introducing the *Desirable Futures with Robots* workshop series to the HRI research community. Static HTML/CSS/JS, designed to be served from GitHub Pages with no build step.

**Live:** <https://desirable-futures-with-robots.org>
**Repository:** <https://github.com/socialminds-ai/desirable-futures-with-robots>

## The workshop kit

`kit.html` is a print-ready, six-page A4 document that bundles everything a researcher needs to run a workshop. Each `<div class="page">` renders as one PDF page. It matches the site's visual identity — cream / ink / terracotta, Fraunces serif — but on a white field for ink economy.

Pages:

1. **Cover** — title, hero illustration, version, license.
2. **Rationale** — the three-section argument (laboratory→industry / dominant framing / reclaiming the narrative) plus the featured question.
3. **Reversing the narrative** — the *what if* bank: four starting prompts plus three blank slots for the researcher to add their own.
4. **Translating for your audience** — short notes for children, adolescents, older adults, and workers (warehouse/care/service).
5. **Workshop formats** — role-play (recommended), drawing, brainstorming, interviews. Each with structure and what to capture.
6. **Workshop report form** — one fillable A4 page per *Desirable Future* the workshop produces.

### Regenerating the PDF

Edit `kit.html`, then:

```bash
./build-pdf.sh
```

This renders `kit.html` to `desirable-futures-kit.pdf` via headless Chrome. Requirements: `google-chrome`, `google-chrome-stable`, or `chromium` on `PATH`. No other dependencies.

You can also preview the kit live in a browser by visiting <http://localhost:8000/kit.html> after starting the local server (see below).

## Local preview

Any static server works. Two options:

```bash
# Python (no install)
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Or Node, if you have it
npx serve .
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000>.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Push these files to the `main` branch of `socialminds-ai/desirable-futures-with-robots`.
2. **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: Deploy from a branch → `main` / `(root)`.**
3. The site will be served at `https://socialminds-ai.github.io/desirable-futures-with-robots/`.
4. For the custom domain: add a `CNAME` file containing `desirable-futures-with-robots.org` and configure the DNS `CNAME` record to point at `socialminds-ai.github.io`.

## Things to replace before going live

1. **Placeholders** (see below).

## Placeholders to commission

One structural visual is still stubbed in the page (the workshops map). The hero illustration and the favicon are in.

### ~~1. Hero illustration~~ — `assets/hero.png` ✓

Integrated. Rendered with `mix-blend-mode: multiply` against the cream background so the illustration sits on the page without a visible rectangle edge. To swap for a new version, drop a new `assets/hero.png` (4:5 aspect, cream-on-cream backdrop reads best).

### 2. Distributed-workshops map — `assets/map.svg`

- **Location**: full-width band inside section VI ("The Series"), aspect ~16:7.
- **Brief**: Sparse, dotted-style world map. Ink-on-cream. Pins (small terracotta circles) at workshop sites. Ideally driven by a tiny `workshops.yaml` later so it updates as workshops register — but a static SVG is fine for launch.
- **Replacement**: same pattern — swap the `.placeholder--map` div for the map image or inline SVG.

### 3. Open Graph card — `assets/og-image.png`

- **Size**: 1200 × 630.
- **Brief**: One line of typography over the cream background: "Desirable Futures with robots" (matching the wordmark style), with the accent-coloured italic "with robots". Bottom-right: small marker "100 workshops · 2026—2027".
- This is what people see when the URL is shared on Slack, Mastodon, BlueSky, X.

### ~~4. Favicon~~ — `assets/favicon.svg` (+ `favicon-32.png`, `favicon-180.png`) ✓

Done. An abstract two-mark composition echoing the hero — an ink organic form alongside a rotated terracotta square — on a rounded cream tile. SVG ships a `prefers-color-scheme: dark` variant for free. Wired into `<head>` of both `index.html` and `kit.html`.

## Editorial choices baked in

- **Audience is HRI researchers, not the general public.** Copy assumes the reader knows what HRI is and what an autonomous robot is. No glossary.
- **Tone is manifesto, not pitch deck.** Long sentences, em-dashes, deliberate restraint with adjectives.
- **The "what if" inversions are the visual centrepiece.** Section IV uses display-scale type per question intentionally — they are the most quotable, screenshot-shareable part of the page.
- **Two dark sections** ("The Dominant Narrative" and "The Horizon") plus the dark Join section break the cream rhythm and carry the emotional turns.
- **No carousels, no parallax, no robot 3D model.** This site is meant to age well.

## Updating coordinators / what-ifs

Both are plain HTML in `index.html`:

- Coordinators: search for `<ul class="coordinators">`.
- What-ifs: search for `<ol class="whatifs">`.

Add or remove `<li>` blocks. The CSS handles layout automatically.
